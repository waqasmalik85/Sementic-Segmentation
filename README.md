### Introduction
A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is implemented. Pre-trained VGG16 is used as an encoder to extract features to classify drive able free space. Decoder is again based on Vgg16 with transposed Convolutional layers and skip connections. Network is able to label all the pixels of an input image as either road surface or not.

### Hyperparameters

- Dropout: 0.2
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Epochs: 20
- Batch size: 4

### Results
Following are some inference images generated by the FCN:

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start
##### Implement
Implement the code in the `main.py` module indicated by the "TODO" comments.
The comments indicated with "OPTIONAL" tag are not required to complete.


##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
**Note** If running this in Jupyter Notebook system messages, such as those regarding test status, may appear in the terminal rather than the notebook.
